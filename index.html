<h3 class="prev-indent-bot">History:</h3><strong>
Himachal Pradesh has a rich history because it has been inhabited by several clans of people at different ages from the beginning of civilization. The earliest of all were the people from the Indus valley civilization, during the second and third millennium BC, and they came here from Gangetic plains only to live life more peacefully. Soon, the Mongolians occupied the region and they were followed by the Aryans. According to the Indian epics, Himachal Pradesh was a conglomeration of several small republics or Janpadas, each constituting a state as well as a cultural unit. Then came the Mughals and kings like Mahmud Ghaznavi, Sikandar Lodi, Timur, etc had conquered many places of the state to establish their supermacy.
After their kingdom started declining, the Gorkhas captured the land but ended up losing the territory to the British in the Anglo-Gorkha war. The British were completely smitten by the sheer beauty of the area and continued with their supermacy over the place from 1858 to 1914. Post-independence, 30 princely states of the area were brought together to form Himachal Pradesh in 1948. When Punjab got geographically recoganised some parts were includes in the latter. In 1971, Himacahal Pradesh emerged as the 18th state of the Indian Union.
